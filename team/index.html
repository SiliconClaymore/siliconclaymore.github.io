    Silicon Claymore's story begins with another team, Larry.
</p>
<p>
    Larry started their rookie year in 2013 with a small team but a large heart. They worked hard and built a great robot, <em>STEVe: the Shooting, Targeting, Elevating, Vehicle</em> It worked well, and we were all proud of it. Sadly, Larry didn't get the funding needed to continue existing and was abandoned.
</p>
<p>
    The future was dark. Babies cried out in the night. The fate of the world was uncertain.
</p>
<p>
    but then, out of the ashes, the phoenix Silicon Claymore was born. It's a new team with (mostly) new members, but it carries the spirit of Larry into the future.

    We operate out of Qsine and some warehouse in south Calgary. It's a nice warehouse though. Pretty big, lots of room
    for our stuff, good times. We've eaten a lot of chips there.
