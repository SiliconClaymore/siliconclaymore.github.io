<p>
	We are Silicon Claymore, FIRSTÂ® (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competition
	Team 5116, a Community team based in Calgary AB, Sponsored by Allsold.ca, Qsine among others. Silicon Claymore is
	a student led team established in mid 2013 to supercede Team 4606 LARRY.
	The 2014 competition year is the first (heh) year that Silicon Claymore has operated.
	<br />
	We operate out of Qsine and some warehouse in south Calgary. It's a nice warehouse though. Pretty big, lots of room
	for our stuff, good times. We've eaten a lot of chips there.
