We are Silicon Claymore, FIRSTÂ® (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competition
Team 5116, a Community team based in Calgary AB, Sponsored by Allsold.ca, Qsine among others.

Silicon Claymore's story begins with another team, Larry.

Larry started their rookie year in 2013 with a small team but a large heart. They worked hard and built a great robot, *STEVe: the Shooting, Targeting, Elevating, Vehicle* It worked well, and we were all proud of it. Sadly, Larry didn't get the funding needed to continue existing and was abandoned.

The future was dark. Babies cried out in the night. The fate of the world was uncertain.

But then, out of the ashes, the phoenix Silicon Claymore was born. It's a new team with (mostly) new members, but it carries the spirit of Larry into the future.

We operate out of Qsine and some warehouse in south Calgary. It's a nice warehouse though. Pretty big, lots of room
for our stuff, good times. We've eaten a lot of chips there.
