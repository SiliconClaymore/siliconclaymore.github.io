FIRST was founded in 1989 to inspire young people's interest and participation in science and technology. Based in Manchester, NH, the 501 (c) (3) not-for-profit public charity designs accessible, innovative programs that motivate young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math, while building self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills.

Silicon Claymore's story begins with another team, Larry.

Larry started their rookie year in 2013 with a small team but a large heart. They worked hard and built a great robot, *STEVe: the Shooting, Targeting, Elevating, Vehicle*. It worked well, and we were all proud of it. Sadly, Larry didn't get the funding needed to continue existing and was abandoned.

The future was dark. Babies cried out in the night. The fate of the world was uncertain.

but then, out of the ashes, the phoenix Silicon Claymore was born. It's a new team with (mostly) new members, but it carries the spirit of Larry into the future.
